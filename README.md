It's dangerous to go alone, stranger! Let me introduce myself: I'm Marco Gemaque, but everybody calls me Marco.

I'm currently data scientist @ Grupo Soma, and I am originally a Petroleum Engineer, I even went offshore and all, but I prefer to
work at a computer, far away from dangerous and explosive things.

My main language is python, but I also use C# in Unity, Julia and currently am learning Dart/Flutter for app development.
